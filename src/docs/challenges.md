# CAD Challenges

## Practice Challenges

Practice challenges are available to all registered users and help you improve your CAD skills at your own pace.

### Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner**: Basic modeling tasks with detailed guidance
- **Intermediate**: More complex shapes and assemblies
- **Advanced**: Complex engineering problems and optimization challenges
- **Expert**: Industry-level designs with specific constraints

### Working with Practice Challenges

1. Browse challenges by difficulty, category, or popularity
2. Select a challenge to view details and requirements
3. Download any provided reference files
4. Create your solution using your preferred CAD software
5. Upload your solution in supported format (STL, STEP, etc.)
6. Receive immediate feedback on your solution
7. Review the model evaluation and suggested improvements

### Challenge Timer

Each challenge includes a timer that:
- Starts automatically when the challenge is opened
- Tracks the total time spent on the challenge
- Continues if you navigate away and return (session-based)
- Stops when you submit your solution
- Records completion time for performance statistics

### Challenge Statistics

Challenge statistics are tracked and updated dynamically:

#### Success Rate
- Calculated as: (Successful Submissions / Total Submissions) Ã— 100%
- Updated in real-time with each new submission
- Visible to all users to indicate challenge difficulty

#### Submission Count
- Total number of submitted solutions for the challenge
- Indicates challenge popularity and engagement level
- Updated whenever a new submission is processed

#### Average Time
- Mean completion time across all successful submissions
- Helps users gauge the expected time investment
- Updates dynamically as new submissions are completed

#### User Performance
- Individual users can compare their completion time to the average
- Personal best times are recorded for repeat attempts
- Performance trends are visualized in user dashboards

### Challenge Submission Methods

Challenges may require different types of submissions:

#### File Uploads
- CAD native files (STEP, STP, F3D, SLDPRT, etc.)
- STL files for 3D printing validation
- Technical drawings (PDF, DWG)
- Supporting documentation

#### Knowledge Checks
- Multiple choice questions about technical concepts
- Fill-in-the-blank questions on formulas or parameters
- Mathematical calculations related to the design
- Short answer questions on design decisions

### Submission Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated through:
- Automated dimensional checks against requirements
- Visual comparison with reference models
- Knowledge check answer verification
- Manual review by experts for complex challenges

### Practice Streaks

Maintain a daily practice streak to:
- Build consistency in your learning
- Earn streak-based achievements
- Improve your visibility on leaderboards
