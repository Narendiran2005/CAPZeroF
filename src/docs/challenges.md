# CAD Challenges

## Practice Challenges

Practice challenges are available to all registered users and help you improve your CAD skills at your own pace.

### Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner**: Basic modeling tasks with detailed guidance
- **Intermediate**: More complex shapes and assemblies
- **Advanced**: Complex engineering problems and optimization challenges
- **Expert**: Industry-level designs with specific constraints

### Working with Practice Challenges

1. Browse challenges by difficulty, category, or popularity
2. Select a challenge to view details and requirements
3. Download any provided reference files
4. Create your solution using your preferred CAD software
5. Upload your solution in supported format (STL, STEP, etc.)
6. Receive immediate feedback on your solution
7. Review the model evaluation and suggested improvements

### Challenge Statistics

Each challenge displays real-time statistics to help users gauge difficulty and track performance:

- **Success Rate**: The percentage of submissions that meet all requirements
- **Submission Count**: Total number of attempts made by all users
- **Average Time**: Mean time taken by users who successfully completed the challenge
- **Your Best Time**: Personal record for completing the challenge (if applicable)

These statistics are dynamically updated as users interact with challenges and automatically recalculated after new submissions.

### Challenge Timer System

The challenge timer automatically starts when a user enters a challenge view:

1. Timer begins counting immediately upon challenge page load
2. Users can pause the timer if needed
3. The elapsed time is recorded with each submission
4. Time metrics are used to calculate performance statistics
5. Organizations can set time limits for competition challenges

### Practice Streaks

Maintain a daily practice streak to:
- Build consistency in your learning
- Earn streak-based achievements
- Improve your visibility on leaderboards
