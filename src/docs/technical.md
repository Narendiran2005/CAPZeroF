## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema

- **Users Table**: Stores user information, credentials, and profile data
- **Organizations Table**: Stores organization details and verification status
- **Challenges Table**: Contains all practice challenges with metadata
- **Competitions Table**: Stores competition details and configurations
- **Submissions Table**: Records all challenge and competition submissions
- **Evaluations Table**: Stores evaluation results for submissions
- **Achievements Table**: Tracks user badges and accomplishments

### API Architecture

The CAD Arena API follows RESTful principles with the following main endpoints:
- `/api/auth`: Authentication and user management
- `/api/challenges`: Practice challenge management
- `/api/competitions`: Competition management
- `/api/submissions`: Submission handling and evaluation
- `/api/profiles`: User profile management

### Authentication and Security

- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Encrypted file storage for design submissions
- Regular security audits and updates

## STL Processing System

CAD Arena uses a specialized system for processing and evaluating STL files:

1. **Validation**: Ensuring file integrity and format compliance
2. **Normalization**: Standardizing scale and orientation
3. **Analysis**: Extracting model metrics (volume, surface area, etc.)
4. **Comparison**: Evaluating similarity to reference models
5. **Scoring**: Calculating final scores based on multiple criteria

## Secure Code Architecture

To protect proprietary evaluation algorithms:

- Server-side processing of all evaluations
- Obfuscated client-side code
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Separation of frontend and backend logic
- Regular code reviews and security testing
